# 22W - Software Development

Problem-solving with Data Structures and Algorithms
- Choosing the right data structure is key
- Solve problems iteratively:
1. Understand the Problem at Hand (Read Excercise Description carefully)
2. Build a model (Paraphrase in your own words, Visualize, Translate into "Python")
3. Validate the model (Look at test cases, especially at input and output data types)
4. Get a quick win (Solve the problem as concrete as possible or only partially first, e.g. by copying test case)
5. Test, Fail, and Repeat towards higher abstraction (Try to find more abstract approaches (variables, conditions, iterations) for parts of your code)
6. Clean your code (Once all tests pass, challenge the current state of your Code and avoid repetitive patterns (DRY Principle))
7. Celebrate!


## Session 1

- Programming as a craft
- Intro to Python and Programming Environments
- Hello World Exercise
- The Vision of full automation
- Darts Exercise (partial solution)

The key takeways:
1. Programming is a craft. Build, Test, Learn, Play, Succeed!
2. Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!" (Functions return specific data types, details matter!)
3. Choose a programing environment that suits your needs (Command-Line, VScode, PyCharm, Repl.it, Github,...). BTW you can also just hit "." on the github repo which will open a codespace for your that looks like VSCode \
4. Don't be afraid to jump in the Pool. Use your common sense (and maybe some basic math and logic) to build an understanding. Learn how to become self-confident about your mental model. Syntax and Implementation are details we can solve via iteration and analysis (in reference ot our darts example).

Please prepare the following things for next week:
1. Attempt about 5 exercises from Session 1, don't expect to solve all of them. If there are more questions than answers, this is where you want to be. Join a study group, don't work alone! Write down all questions and bring them to class
2. Take a look at my annotated darts repo: https://github.com/DB-Teaching/02-14-darts-dominikb1888. Read about variable assignment, scoping and conditions in python, if you are interested. We will talk more about this next week!
