# 22W - Software Development

Problem-solving with Data Structures and Algorithms
- Choosing the right data structure is key
- Solve problems iteratively:
1. Understand the Problem at Hand (Read Excercise Description carefully)
2. Build a model (Paraphrase in your own words, Visualize, Translate into "Python")
3. Validate the model (Look at test cases, especially at input and output data types)
4. Get a quick win (Solve the problem as concrete as possible or only partially first, e.g. by copying test case)
5. Test, Fail, and Repeat towards higher abstraction (Try to find more abstract approaches (variables, conditions, iterations) for parts of your code)
6. Clean your code (Once all tests pass, challenge the current state of your Code and avoid repetitive patterns (DRY Principle))
7. Celebrate!
