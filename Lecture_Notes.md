# 22W - Software Development

## Session 1

### Class Content
- Introduced Python hands-on

### Minimum Achievement:

- Understand Github Classroom (Clone, Commit, Push)
- Have an Editor Set-up and know how to use it
- Have committed two exercises with fully or partially working code
- Be able to explain own issues around the tools or the programming exercises


## Session 2

- Introduction to Primitive Types in Python

#### Numbers

- Boolean (0,1 | True,False)
- Int (42)
- Float (42.23)


## Session 3

- Recap of Exercises 1 and 2 with Q&A


## Session 4

- Introduction to Complex Types, Mutability and Immutability

#### Immutable Sequences

- String `"Olivia"`
- Tuple  `("Dominik", 42)`


#### Mutable Sequences

- List `["Marina", "Marina", "Johnson", "Madalina", "Kizito", "Sharima"]`
- Set `{1,2,3,4,5}`
- Dict
``` python
{'name': 'Marina',
 'age': '42',
 'students': ['Marina', 'Marina', 'Johnson', 'Madalina', 'Kizito', 'Sharima']}
```


### ToDo:

- Focus more on Mutable Sequences (esp. Dict was very short)
- Data Types not discussed (Date, collections, Enum)
- Very brief on choosing data types (Focus next session)


### Minumum Achievement

- Have at least 4 Exercises submitted


## Session 5

- Review of Exercises (Leap, Grains)

### ToDo:

- Prepare Grains exercise next time



## Session 6

### Class Content

- Review of pangram excersize
- Problem-solving with Data Structures and Algorithms
- Choosing the right data structure is key
- Solve problems iteratively:

1. Understand the Problem at Hand (Read Excercise Description carefully)
2. Build a model (Paraphrase in your own words, Visualize, Translate into "Python")
3. Validate the model (Look at test cases, especially at input and output data types)
4. Get a quick win (Solve the problem as concrete as possible or only partially first, e.g. by copying test case)
5. Test, Fail, and Repeat towards higher abstraction (Try to find more abstract approaches (variables, conditions, iterations) for parts of your code)
6. Clean your code (Once all tests pass, challenge the current state of your Code and avoid repetitive patterns (DRY Principle))
7. Celebrate!

### Minimum Achievement

- Have at least 8 exercises from both Session and Session 2 completed



## Session 7

### Lecture

- Brief introduction to conditionals and iteration





## ARCHIVE

## Session 4

### Class Content

- Functions as building block of code
- Problem-solving exercise: Darts (https://github.com/DB-Teaching/02-14-darts-dominikb1888)


## Session 5

### Class Content

- Extended Problem-solving exercise: Darts with dynamic input (https://github.com/DB-Teaching/02-14-darts-dominikb1888)
- Introduction to Comprehensions


## Session 6

### Class Content

- Introduction of Decorators
- Problem-solving on Sum of Multiples Exercise: https://github.com/DB-Teaching/03-04-sum-of-multiples-dominikb1888

## Session 7

- What matters for Digital Projects?
- Why? What? How?

- Understand the why, e.g. the mission your stakeholders are on.
- Understand the what, e.g. the more specific obstacles they are trying to overcome on their journey
- Define the how,e.g. what would be a good way to solve their problems

### Concrete Example for Leaderboard App
1. Stakeholders: Mentor, Students
2. Why?
- Mentor: Help each student individually to become a professional developer
- Students: Become a better developer, build skills and confidence

3. What?
- Understand progress of students (Comparison, Individual Attention)
- Encourage and Motivate through transparency and competition
- Allow for peer feedback and support
- Show statistics on the whole operation and its effectiveness

4. How?
- Show a heatmap visualization with finished exercises per session
- Show a percentile plot for comparing you own progress with that of all others
- Allow for publishing own repositories and listing them on the progress board
- Show metastatistics on reaction time and quality of comments/code


### Class Content

- Object-oriented Programming Principles
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

## Session 8

### Class Content

- In-depth discussion of procedural solution to the matching brackets exercise
- Repetition of OOP-Principles
- Introduction to @staticmethod decorator: classes as namespaces vs. classes with data bindings

### ToDo

- get more consistent metaphor/examples for OOP-Principles
